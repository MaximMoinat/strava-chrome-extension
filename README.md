# Strava Chrome Extension
### Goal
Get a better overview of interval laps on the Strava Workout page. With this extension one should be able to filter the slow laps, leaving an overview of just the intervals run.

Based on [this nice blog post](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/)
